## [Unreleased]

_Pending changes accumulate here. `owl:versionInfo` / `owl:versionIRI` are bumped only at a release cut._

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Migrated all IRIs from `github.io/ADIRO` to `w3id.org/adiro`** — ontology IRI, `owl:versionIRI` base, term namespace, and internal `owl:imports` ([#53](https://github.com/BuroHappoldMachineLearning/ADIRO/issues/53)). w3id is the permanent, content-negotiating identifier (redirects to the unchanged GitHub Pages host). Every term IRI changes → a **MAJOR** bump at the next release cut. Fetch URLs on Pages and CVAT labels (URI-local-name-derived) are unaffected.

### Added
- Ontology-header provenance metadata (`dcterms:title`, `dcterms:description`, `dcterms:license`, `dcterms:creator`, `dcterms:publisher`) for FAIR / registry readiness (#50).

## [1.0.0]

Initial in-repo baseline (not yet cut as a GitHub release). No earlier released version to diff against.
