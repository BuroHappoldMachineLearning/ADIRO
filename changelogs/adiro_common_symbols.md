## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **BREAKING: renamed from `aec_common_symbols`** ([#171](https://github.com/BuroHappoldMachineLearning/ADIRO/issues/171)). The module, its ontology IRI and the IRI of every term it defines now use `adiro_common_symbols` (`https://w3id.org/adiro/adiro_common_symbols`) instead of `aec_common_symbols`; the title says "ADIRO" instead of "AEC". Nothing else changes: the terms, their definitions and their axioms are those of `aec_common_symbols`'s final release, whose version this release follows with a MAJOR bump. Every release of the old module stays published at its own IRI and is named here with `owl:priorVersion`; its history is in [its changelog](aec_common_symbols.md). The example images are published under the new module's path. `migration/aec_to_adiro.ttl` maps each old term IRI to the new one, and `scripts/migrate_aec_to_adiro.py` rewrites a graph or a list of links. Downstream consumers need to move to the new IRIs, including the annotation tooling, which reads the class IRIs and the labelling annotations.
